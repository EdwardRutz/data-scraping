## KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH FIREFOX WEBDRIVER IN CATALINA
macOS 10.15 (Catalina):

Due to the recent requirement from Apple that all programs must
be notarized, geckodriver will not work on Catalina if you manually
download it through another notarized program, such as Firefox.

- Best to use Chrome webdriver for now.
